## Overview

Dramatic Rolls is an exciting module for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) that adds a touch of drama and excitement to your natural 20s and natural 1s! Enhance your gaming experience with customizable sound effects, eye-catching animations, and confetti explosions that celebrate critical successes and emphasize critical failures. Whether you're landing a perfect hit or fumbling spectacularly, Dramatic Rolls ensures these pivotal moments are marked with flair, creating memorable experiences for both players and Game Masters alike.

For users of the Pathfinder 2e game system, Dramatic Rolls offers additional options to trigger effects based on critical successes and failures, even when the result isn't from a natural 20 or 1. This feature takes into account the Pathfinder 2e degree of success system, allowing for more nuanced and system-specific dramatic moments during gameplay.
